The little bell lies on the ground<br>Although it tries it cannot sound<br>It used to ring across the air<br>Its sweetened tone would linger there<br><br>But from a careless hand it rocked<br>Its shell is only made of crock<br>Although it lies there split in two<br>It still tries to ring out to you<br><br><a href="http://futurecrayon.blogspot.com/">Broadcast - The Little Bell</a>
